                        <p style="color: whitesmoke; font-weight: bolder; text-shadow:  1px 1px black;"> 
                            I once lived in a place on a river bank in Australia </br>
                             and would sit and watch the platypus in the morning,
                             as I'd drink a coffee. </br>
                            The elusive, furry platypus,
                            Is a surviving monotreme, </br>
                            Living above and below the water, 
                            Of any Aussie stream, </br>

                            Where it lives a pure autonomous life, 
                            With a bric a brac design, </br>
                            Made up from bits of others, 
                            A sort of animal Frankenstein, </br>

                            With its duck bill mouth and otter foot,
                            And beaver sort of tail, </br>
                            And then it’s got its venomous poison, 
                            In a curly black toenail, </br>

                            And, as a mammal, what’s really odd, 
                            It lays eggs like a chook… </br>
                            These are reasons I love spotting platypus,
                            When they’re swimming in a brook. </p>

                            <h5>The Man from Snowy River</h5>
                            <p>There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around
                                That the colt from old Regret had got away, </br>
                                And had joined the wild bush horses - he was worth a thousand pound,
                                So all the cracks had gathered to the fray. </br>
                                All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far
                                Had mustered at the homestead overnight,</br>
                                For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,
                                And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight.</p>
                                
                             <p>There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,
                                The old man with his hair as white as snow; </br>
                                But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up-
                                He would go wherever horse and man could go.</br>
                                And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand,
                                No better horseman ever held the reins; </br>
                                For never horse could throw him while the saddle girths would stand,
                                He learnt to ride while droving on the plains.</p>
                                
                             <p>And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast,
                                He was something like a racehorse undersized, </br>
                                With a touch of Timor pony - three parts thoroughbred at least -
                                And such as are by mountain horsemen prized. </br>
                                He was hard and tough and wiry - just the sort that won't say die -
                                There was courage in his quick impatient tread; </br>
                                And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye,
                                And the proud and lofty carriage of his head.</p>
                                
                             <p>But so slight and weedy, one would doubt his power to stay,
                                And the old man said, "That horse will never do </br>
                                For a long and tiring gallop-lad, you'd better stop away,
                                Those hills are far too rough for such as you." </br>
                                So he waited sad and wistful - only Clancy stood his friend -
                                "I think we ought to let him come," he said; </br>
                                "I warrant he'll be with us when he's wanted at the end,
                                For both his horse and he are mountain bred."</p>
                                
                            <p> "He hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko's side,
                                Where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough, </br>
                                Where a horse's hoofs strike firelight from the flint stones every stride,
                                The man that holds his own is good enough. </br>
                                And the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their home,
                                Where the river runs those giant hills between; </br>
                                I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam,
                                But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen."</p>
                                
                             <p>So he went - they found the horses by the big mimosa clump -
                                They raced away towards the mountain's brow, </br>
                                And the old man gave his orders, "Boys, go at them from the jump,
                                No use to try for fancy riding now. </br>
                                And, Clancy, you must wheel them, try and wheel them to the right.
                                Ride boldly, lad, and never fear the spills, </br>
                                For never yet was rider that could keep the mob in sight,
                                If once they gain the shelter of those hills." </p>
                                
                             <p>So Clancy rode to wheel them - he was racing on the wing
                                Where the best and boldest riders take their place, </br>
                                And he raced his stockhorse past them, and he made the ranges ring
                                With stockwhip, as he met them face to face. </br>
                                Then they halted for a moment, while he swung the dreaded lash,
                                But they saw their well-loved mountain full in view, </br>
                                And they charged beneath the stockwhip with a sharp and sudden dash,
                                And off into the mountain scrub they flew.</p>
                                
                             <p>Then fast the horsemen followed, where the gorges deep and black
                                Resounded to the thunder of their tread,  </br>
                                And the stockwhips woke the echoes, and they fiercely answered back
                                From cliffs and crags that beetled overhead. </br>
                                And upward, ever upward, the wild horses held their sway,
                                Were mountain ash and kurrajong grew wide; </br>
                                And the old man muttered fiercely, "We may bid the mob good day,
                                No man can hold them down the other side." </p>
                                
                             <p>When they reached the mountain's summit, even Clancy took a pull,
                                It well might make the boldest hold their breath, </br>
                                The wild hop scrub grew thickly, and the hidden ground was full
                                Of wombat holes, and any slip was death. </br>
                                But the man from Snowy River let the pony have his head,
                                And he swung his stockwhip round and gave a cheer, </br>
                                And he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down its bed,
                                While the others stood and watched in very fear. </p>
                                
                             <p>He sent the flint stones flying, but the pony kept his feet,
                                He cleared the fallen timbers in his stride, </br>
                                And the man from Snowy River never shifted in his seat -
                                It was grand to see that mountain horseman ride. </br>
                                Through the stringybarks and saplings, on the rough and broken ground,
                                Down the hillside at a racing pace he went; </br>
                                And he never drew the bridle till he landed safe and sound,
                                At the bottom of that terrible descent. </p>
                                
                            <p> He was right among the horses as they climbed the further hill
                                And the watchers on the mountain standing mute, </br>
                                Saw him ply the stockwhip fiercely, he was right among them still,
                                As he raced across the clearing in pursuit. </p>
                                
                             <p>Then they lost him for a moment, where two mountain gullies met
                                In the ranges, but a final glimpse reveals </br>
                                On a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet,
                                With the man from Snowy River at their heels. </p>
                                
                            <p> And he ran them single-handed till their sides were white with foam.
                                He followed like a bloodhound in their track, </br>
                                Till they halted cowed and beaten, then he turned their heads for home,
                                And alone and unassisted brought them back. </br>
                                But his hardy mountain pony he could scarcely raise a trot,
                                He was blood from hip to shoulder from the spur; </br>
                                But his pluck was still undaunted, and his courage fiery hot,
                                For never yet was mountain horse a cur. </p>
                                
                            <p> And down by Kosciusko, where the pine-clad ridges raise
                                Their torn and rugged battlements on high, </br>
                                Where the air is clear as crystal, and the white stars fairly blaze
                                At midnight in the cold and frosty sky, </br>
                                And where around The Overflow the reed beds sweep and sway
                                To the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide, </br>
                                The man from Snowy River is a household word today,
                                And the stockmen tell the story of his ride.</p>

                    <p>  “At peace in the world, alone with her joey, 
                        A soft breeze ruffles her hair, </br>
                        Amongst the green of life all around,

                        One final truth she now understands, </br>
                        No time to think, for today is her last, 
                        As the fire rips through her home land.”</p>
